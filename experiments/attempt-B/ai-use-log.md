# AI Use Log — Attempt B

Per-turn log for the context-engineered reimplementation. Assignment rule #3 requires ≥ 20 entries documenting what was done and what was learned.

## Entry template

```
## Turn N — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <file or task>

Prompt intent: <one line>
Context loaded: <SPEC, CLAUDE.md, skill:X, plan-task-N>
Result: <summary + file paths>
Lint / tests: <pass/fail; what was fixed>
Hand-edit: <none | file:lines, reason>
Learning: <one line — what worked or did not>
```

## Turn 1 — 2026-04-22 — SPEC.md + ai-use-log.md bootstrap

Prompt intent: Author the lean implementation-facing SPEC.md and bootstrap the log file so every subsequent turn can append in place.
Context loaded: design spec §1–§10 (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-data-heist-attempt-b-design.md)
Result:
- Created `SPEC.md` — condensed reference covering game rules, symbols, weights, paytable, paylines, state, RTP target, differentiators, responsive, out-of-scope.
- Created `ai-use-log.md` with template and this first entry.
Lint / tests: N/A (no code yet).
Hand-edit: none.
Learning: Splitting "WHAT (SPEC)" from "HOW (CLAUDE.md, skills)" makes each file single-responsibility, which matches the brainstorming decision that §§4–5 of the design doc are distinct concerns. Also: creating the log file at Turn 1 (not Turn 4 as originally planned) lets every later turn append cleanly without backfilling timestamps.

Plan deviation: Turn 1 creates `ai-use-log.md` in addition to `SPEC.md` — this is a small reordering of plan Task 4's ai-use-log creation to Task 1. Logged for traceability; no design impact.
